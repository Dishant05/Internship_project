<h1>Azure Chatbot with QnA Maker</h1>
<h2>Project Statement</h2>
Corona Virus is one of the troublesome and deadliest virus that we all have faced. It nearly destroyed mental Health of every human being and ruined the economy beyond the point where it cannot be easily recovered. In such trying times where the 4th wave is the looming threat, it is important that people understand about the precautions and safety measures they should be taking to avoid this disease to take over once again. A chatbot having the data regarding Covid in this scenario can help in spreading important information to people who still don't know much about or are currently having Covid.

<h2> Azure Technolgies/Services Used</h2>
1. Azure QnA Maker</br>
2. Azure Chatbot Service/Web App Bot

<h2>Project Description</h2>
Corona Chatbot uses the technology of Azure QnA Maker Service that helps in creation of the knowledge base for this bot. This QnA maker extracts the information from various trusted health sites that it will be using to answer the queries typed by the users. Now the Azure Chatbot Service will be used to publish the bot created using the QnA knowledge base. Through this service, a basic chatbox is created which can answer queries on various platforms such as twitter, etc. 

<h2>Knowledge Base using QnA Maker</h2>
Here is the screenshot of the Knowledge Base used in this bot. All the queries in this are present in the Covid QnA Excelsheet.
